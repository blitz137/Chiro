        <p>Smith Chiropractic exists to heal from the inside
        out. We understand that when the body isn’t
        functioning as it was designed to, the whole system
        gets buggy.</p>
        <p>
        We service a wide variety of patient needs by
        assessing and correcting mechanical dysfunctions.

        <p>However, we specialize in correcting cervical and
        lumbar (sciatica) disc disorders and identify and
        correct athletic injuries.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to send every patient home with a hug. A
        very big hug. We believe that happiness heals.</p>
